# Debugging
## For VS Code
Install latest version of [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [VS Code Chrome Debugger Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=msjsdiag.debugger-for-chrome) installed.

Start your app by running npm start, and start debugging in VS Code by pressing F5 or by clicking the green debug icon. You can now write code, set breakpoints, make changes to the code, and debug your newly modified codeâ€”all from your editor.

For more information about debugging see debugging section under full user guide.
